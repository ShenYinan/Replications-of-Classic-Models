# Replications-of-Classic-Models

1. The code of comparing MSE, rof and so on against mtry parameter is based on paper of Hastie(2020). I also compare the regularization effect of mtry with ridge regression and lasso regression.
2. Projection Pursuit Algorithm is based on paper of Friedman(1974) and I also consider some other transformations.
